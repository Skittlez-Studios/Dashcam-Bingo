    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <span class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 30, 2026</span>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Dashcam Bingo</strong> mobile application (herein referred to as "the Application") created by <strong>Skittlez Studios</strong>. The Application is provided as an Ad-Supported service intended for use "as is".</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>While the Application does not require user accounts or direct personal information (such as your name or email address), it uses third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) provided by Google to display advertisements and analyze app performance.</p>
    <p>These third-party services collect data as described in their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Safety Disclosure</h2>
    <p>In compliance with the Google Play Data Safety requirements, the following information is collected and shared via the Google AdMob SDK:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> Derived from your IP address to show relevant regional ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Including the Advertising ID (AAID) for ad targeting, frequency capping, and fraud prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> Interactions with ads, such as clicks or video views.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Technical crash logs and performance data to ensure the Application remains stable and secure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Deletion & User Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not host your data on any private servers.</strong> All data collection is handled by Google’s AdMob infrastructure. You can exercise your right to delete or restrict your data by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Resetting or deleting your Advertising ID through your device settings: <em>Settings > Google > Ads > Reset/Delete Advertising ID</em>.</li>
        <li>Opting out of personalized ads in your Google Account settings.</li>
        <li>Contacting us via the email below for any specific privacy-related requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>Data transmitted off-device is encrypted in transit using <strong>HTTPS/TLS protocols</strong>. Google retains data such as Ad IDs and crash reports according to its own retention policies, typically for as long as necessary to provide ad services and analytics.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The Application is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent and believe data has been collected incorrectly, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>6. International Users (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
